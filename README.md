# exploratory-data-analysis
Exploratory data analysis and various types of plots using the Iris dataset


## Getting started

To run this notebook and all of these plots, start by cloning this repo and navigating to
the current directory and running the following commands:

```
$ virtualenv env/exploratory-data-analysis -p python3.6
$ source env/exploratory-data-analysis/bin/activate
$ pip install jupyter numpy plotly scipy scikit-learn scikit-image
$ jupyter-notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000
```

Then copy the URL returned by the last command into your browser; it should look something like this:

> http://localhost:8889/?token=17bbe9525ee99e3...

Once you're in the notebook portal, navigate to *code>exploratory_iris.ipynb* to launch the notebook.
